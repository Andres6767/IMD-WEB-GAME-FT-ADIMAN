Flappy Bird Remake🐦 Project Overview: This is a modern web-based remake of the classic mobile game, Flappy Bird. The game is implemented entirely using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript with the game rendering handled by the HTML <canvas> element.

This project was developed by [Andres] and [Adiman] for [IMD1000A:ITEC1100A, interactive multimedia design] as the final game development assignment.🚀 

Getting Started: To run the game, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Since the game is purely client-side, no external server is required unless hosted online (as per requirement).The live version is hosted at: [ ]🕹️ 

How to Play: The objective is to guide the bird through the gaps between the pipes without hitting any obstacles or the ground.
